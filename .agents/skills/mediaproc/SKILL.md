name: mediaproc
description: Process media files (video, audio, images) via a locked-down SSH container with ffmpeg, sox, and imagemagick. Use when the user wants to transcode video, process audio, manipulate images, or work with media files.
compatibility: Requires ssh and a running mediaproc instance. MEDIAPROC_HOST and MEDIAPROC_PORT env vars must be set.

# mediaproc

Locked-down media processing over SSH. Built on [lockbox](https://github.com/psyb0t/docker-lockbox) — no shell access, no injection, no bullshit.

For installation and deployment, see [references/setup.md](references/setup.md).

## Security model

mediaproc is **not** a general-purpose shell, and `scripts/mediaproc.sh` is **not**
arbitrary remote code execution even though it forwards a free-form-looking command
string. The instance runs inside a [lockbox](https://github.com/psyb0t/docker-lockbox)-
hardened container, and this skill only ever talks to an instance you (or your
operator) already run and trust:

- **Key-auth only** — SSH accepts public-key auth only (no passwords), connecting
  as a restricted user. There is no interactive shell and no PTY.
- **Server-side enforced allow-list, not documentation** — `scripts/mediaproc.sh`
  passes its argument through to the SSH channel as-is, but the *remote* lockbox
  dispatcher is what decides what runs, and it only ever executes the fixed set
  documented below: `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `sox`, `soxi`, `convert`, `identify`,
  `magick`, plus lockbox's built-in, scoped file operations. This is an enforced
  allow-list on the server, not a client-side convention — the wrapper cannot be
  used to run anything outside that set. Any other command name is refused before
  execution; the remote never spawns a shell, so there is no shell-injection
  surface and no way to chain (`;`, `|`, `&&`, backticks, etc.) into a second
  command.
- **Work-dir confined** — every path resolves under the instance work directory
  (`/work`); traversal is blocked. The sandbox cannot read or write your host
  filesystem.
- **Consumer-only** — this skill moves files to/from a running instance and runs
  the whitelisted media tools on them. It never provisions, escalates, or installs
  anything on your machine (server setup is a separate, operator-side step — see
  setup.md).
- **You must still trust the configured host** — `MEDIAPROC_HOST`/`MEDIAPROC_PORT`
  point at a specific instance. The allow-list constrains *what* runs, not *where*;
  if `MEDIAPROC_HOST` is pointed at an instance you don't control, that operator
  still sees every file you `put`/`get` and every command you send. Only point
  this skill at a mediaproc instance you or a trusted operator run.

## SSH Wrapper

Use `scripts/mediaproc.sh` for all commands. It handles host, port, and host key acceptance via `MEDIAPROC_HOST` and `MEDIAPROC_PORT` env vars.

The `<command>` argument looks free-form but is not arbitrary execution: the
remote lockbox dispatcher enforces the allow-list from the Security model above,
server-side, on every invocation.

```bash
scripts/mediaproc.sh <command> [args]
scripts/mediaproc.sh <command> < input_file
scripts/mediaproc.sh <command> > output_file
```
